## Solutions to Coding Questions for practice in Java.

I took reference from the book Cracking the Coding Interview and LeetCode. This readme file includes problems to practice and you can refer to the solutions from the code present in repo.

If you have some new approach feel free to add a merge request, but make sure it is correct branch.

It includes various topics like:
### Data Structures
- Arrays and Strings
  - Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all the unique characters.What if you cannot use additional data structures? 
  - Given two strings, write a method to determine if one is a permutation of the other.
  - Reverse Integer
  - Reverse String
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
